# CardapioFacil Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural documentation for the CardapioFacil system, focusing on service boundaries, integration patterns, and design decisions.

## Documents

- [WhatsApp Integration](./whatsapp-integration.md) - Details the architectural boundaries and integration flow for WhatsApp communication

## Core Architectural Principles

1. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Clear service boundaries between the five core services
   - Each service is independently deployable and scalable
   - Services communicate via well-defined APIs

2. **Strict Service Boundaries**
   - WhatsApp Service handles all WhatsApp communication
   - User Management Service manages user profiles and authentication
   - Meal Planning Service generates meal plans and grocery lists
   - Content Management Service manages recipe database
   - Analytics Service handles metrics and reporting

3. **API-First Design**
   - RESTful API design with consistent endpoint naming
   - API versioning (v1, v2, etc.)
   - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
   - Rate limiting on all public endpoints

4. **Security by Design**
   - API key authentication for service-to-service communication
   - Input validation for all endpoints
   - Protection against common vulnerabilities
   - LGPD compliance for user data

## Integration Patterns

The CardapioFacil system uses the following integration patterns:

1. **API Gateway Pattern**
   - Each service exposes a well-defined API
   - Services communicate via HTTP/HTTPS

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Services publish events that other services can subscribe to
   - Asynchronous communication for non-critical operations

3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Prevents cascading failures between services
   - Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Mock external dependencies

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test communication between services
   - Verify correct data flow

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete user flows
   - Verify system behavior from user perspective

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Container-Based Deployment**
   - Docker containers for all services
   - Kubernetes for orchestration

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated testing on each PR
   - Deployment pipeline: dev → staging → production

3. **Environment Isolation**
   - Separate environments for development, testing, and production
   - Environment-specific configurations
